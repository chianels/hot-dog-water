        <h1>About hotdog water</h1>
        <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
        <p>One of the greatest questions humanity can ask. One answer, nobody knows. This is the most useless site ever made. Did I have fun making this? Most defenitly, (idk how to spell that word). But yeah, my plan was selling hot dog water as a perfume but people didn't seem to like that idea. I made marketing plans, styleguides, mock ups, but it was in vain. Nobody believed in me. So here I am, making a website for hot dogs. And what kind of hot dogs hehe. Of course I made everthing myself, coded everything by hand, no help from anyone. That's how good I am ☺️</p>
        <h2>What are my plans with this abdomination?</h2>
        <p>To be fair, I have no idea. I started this project just because I thought I could. Maybe this will become a project in the long run that will get bigger in time. Adding more interesting pages, more things you didn't know, more games like Hot Dog Dog. Who knows? Well, I do, cuz I made it and am willing to expand the site. I have motivation to put the most stupid and ugly shit ever on here.

       <h1>Things that keep me up at night</h1>
       <h2>A few things</h2>
       <li>Sometimes I don't know if people actually like me or they just nice cuz they want my money?</li>
       <li>Am I just ugly or is there something wrong with every mirror and camera ever?</li>
       <li>When is it my time to shine? I mean, I suffered enough, it's my time!!</li>
       <li>What would I have been doing if I stayed in China? Prolly dead idk.</li>
       <li>So when the moon dies out, does that mean we all gonna die?</li>
       <li>Will I ever be happy enough to know that I am actually happy?</li>
       <li>Do I really deserve all the good in my life? I mean, I did really shitty shit in my life. Why would I get good stuff for it?</li>
       <li>When do I know that people are done with me? Isn't there a way to kind of detect so I can leave them first?</li>
       <li>Is it normal to cry out of nothing? Nothing happened, but I just cry?</li>
       <li></li>
